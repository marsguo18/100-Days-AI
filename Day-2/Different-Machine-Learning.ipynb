    "## Supervised learning \n",
    "Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples.\n",
    "## Unsupervised learning\n",
    "Unsupervised learning is a branch of machine learning that learns from test data that has not been labeled, classified or categorized. Instead of responding to feedback, unsupervised learning identifies commonalities in the data and reacts based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data. Alternatives include supervised learning and reinforcement learning.\n",
    "## Regression\n",
    "Regression: the output variable takes continuous values.\n",

    "Classification: the output variable takes class labels."
